# This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file
# In a real deployment, this would be an actual ICO file
# For development, browsers will use a default favicon
# 
# To add a real favicon:
# 1. Create a favicon.ico file (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes)
# 2. Replace this text file with the actual ICO file
# 3. Or use an online favicon generator
